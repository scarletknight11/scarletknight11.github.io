                Created a multi-platform system consisting of sensors and camera designed to help analyze a baby’s sleeping position and other conditions to help parents and caretakers properly assess and improve a child’s bedtime. Studies have shown that sleeping sideways or on his/her belly increases the chance of non-desirable health conditions for a developing baby, potentially leading to deaths due to reasons such as the inability to breathe properly. (https://www.nichd.nih.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pubs/documents/SIDS_QA-508-rev.pdf). Therefore, it is recommended that babies to be sleeping on their back to minimize such risks. However, it is impossible for a human to keep track of a baby’s position all night long. Therefore, we have decided to build an application that would send notifications that would alert parents to change the baby’s position, serving as an immeasurable tool that eases the burden of child care. This application would be responsible for constantly monitoring a baby's health by tracking metrics such as physical body posture, head position, and breathing frequency.

				A nervous system disorder involving repetitive movements or unwanted sounds. There are more than 200,000 US cases per year and approximately 10-15 percent of those affected have a progressive or disabling course that lasts into adulthood. X-Waves tries to teach a “competing response,” which is the essence of habit reversal therapy. Since the brain can’t do two tics in the exact same instant, physical tics can essentially be neutralized over time.
				The user can associate sound patterns to the feeling of comfort felt after doing physical tics, hence creating a reinforcing action that can convert physical tics to mental tics

			Devoloped VR Clothing Simulation to help users with a novel method of interacting with clothing items sold by retail companies.
			<br>Problems Faced By Customers:<br>
			<br>Certain customers may not be able to try on a clothing item due to monetary reasons.<br>
			
			<br>If a customer wants to see how they look in a new item of clothing, he or she must travel to the store and physically try it on.<br>
            
			<br>Main Objectives:<br>
			<br>Allow people to see how they look in different looks in 3D space<br>
			
			<br>Provide users with a changing room<br>
			
			<br>Implement an online shopping platform that incorporates the aforementioned objectives<br>
			<br>Detailed Objectives:<br>
			<br>Allow the user to zoom in and zoom out of the item of clothing and allow the user to interact with the clothing item<br>
			<br>Allow the user to choose from a database of clothing items in an intuitive manner<br>
			<br>Allow the user to choose his or her gender as to reflect his or her body type<br>
			<br>Technologies used to build this: Unity3D, Leap motion and Oculus Rift.<br>
			
			<br>Unity and Oculus Rift: The primary VR engine we utilized was Unity and our main programming language is C#. The Oculus Rift provides the means of connecting the user to the virtual reality world.<br>
			<br>Leap Motion: In order to track the movement of the hands and finger motions of the user, we utilized Leap Motion. The Interaction Engine allowed us to work with to connect this method of user input to VR. The Leap Motion sensor is attached to the laptop running the Unity scripts.<br>

			<br>Next goals to further this project:<br>
			<br>Implement machine learning and computer vision as to further tailor the human 3D model as to include parameters such as body shape, skin color, height, and etc.<br>
			<br>Scan the user's face and project the image onto the 3D human model<br>
			<br>Improve the mapping of the clothing onto the 3D human model<br>

			  Final class Project.
			  The car will move based on mouse click input where you click destination and it will drive there using the shortest pathfinding algorithm known A*. Car is able to drive through the street when the user clicks on a location, let's say where pedestrians are walking. The car will first let the pedestrians cross the street before it moves to its clicked location. The car also knows how to recognize detour areas and know which detour areas to avoid.
			  Click to move car navigation mostly worked with custom a* code, but wound up having a bug with setting the point programmatically so we, unfortunately, couldn’t run the simulation properly to collect data

			<h1>Topics in AI for Humanoid Animation</h1>
			<p>Research oritented course (CS443) taken @ Rutgers University, taught by Dr. Mubbasir Kapadia. Course involves innvoating new research project using 3D game engines and other core cutting edge technologies such as AI/ML, Computer Vision & more. In addition, weekly lectures involve talks from presentors who are expert in reseacrh areas of crowd simulation environments, computer animation, virtual worlds & more. Goal of this course is to learn about latest research done in the field of computer graphics, listen to asstounding researchers present there work & have students make projects that can have potential publication value to research conferences such IEEE, Siggraph & more.</p>

			Applications of encouraging human-aware designs to inform architectural decisions extend beyond finding alternative floor plans. Instead, this research can be used to assess the accessibility of buildings and critical situations including  evacuation. In cases where architects do incorporate human-building interactions within their floor plan, it is difficult to assess the appropriateness of a floor plan for inclusive populations, including agents who are handicapped. Wayfinding is especially of importance and a key problem area, proving the need to make data-driven decisions for human-aware design. Additional areas on issue include accessibility for different disabilities, including wheelchairs, visual impairment,  etc. Within each situation, there are different assessments of building floor plans. An important example of such is assessing emergency evacuations of buildings, which can be analyzed and optimized through simulations of movement during evacuations to find and correct possible bottleneck areas in a structure [8]. As specified through relevant research, it is of utmost importance to consider these critical agents when taking design considerations, only done through quantitative and qualitative analysis of human-building interactions.
